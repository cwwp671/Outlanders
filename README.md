# Outlanders
The Capstone project of the 2013 – 2014 Senior Class at NHTI. The project became larger than any of us imagined at the beginning of the semester, and many of us planned on working on it after school was done. Sadly due to a game breaking crash, that we spent months trying to fix, it was decided to leave the game as is and move onto other projects.

The player can choose between four different classes, each of which have 5 abilities, 4 usable and 1 passive. Players go up against their friends in two different game modes, locally, or online using Steam

Some of the highlights of the project are:

- Steamworks integration to be able to play through Steam
- MOBA style Ability, and Level Up, system
- Real time melee combat
- Four Different Classes – Each with 4 usable abilities and 1 passive ability
    - Warrior
    - Mage
    - Archer
    - Barbarian
- Two Game Modes
    - Free For All
    - Team Death Match
